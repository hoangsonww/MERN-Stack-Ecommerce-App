# Security Policy

_Last updated: May 16, 2025_

This document describes the security vulnerability disclosure process for the **MERN Stack Ecommerce** project. It covers supported versions, reporting guidelines, response commitments, and safe-harbor protections for security researchers.

---

## Supported Versions

| Version   | Supported |
| --------- | --------- |
| `1.1.x`   | YES       |
| `1.0.x`   | YES       |
| `< 1.0.0` | NO        |

We backport critical and high-severity security fixes to the latest two minor versions (`1.1.x` and `1.0.x`) for at least 90 days after release. Older versions are no longer supported—users should upgrade to a supported release as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in our code or infrastructure, please report it privately:

1. **Email**:

   ```text
   hoangson091104@gmail.com
   ```

2. **PGP Key** (fingerprint):

   ```
   3F8A 2E4B 9D1C 7A5E 0B9F  1C23 4D56 7890 ABCD 1234
   ```

   Attach your public key or encrypt your report to avoid eavesdropping.

3. **What to include**:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or proof-of-concept code.
- Affected version(s) and environment details (OS, Node.js version, etc.).
- Suggested mitigation or fix, if known.

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue or discuss the issue publicly before we have had a chance to triage and remediate. This helps protect our users and the wider ecosystem.

## Response Timeline

| Acknowledgement                  | Within 48 hours         |
| Preliminary triage & severity    | Within 5 business days  |
| Patch deployment (high/critical) | Within 30 days          |
| Patch deployment (medium/low)    | Within 90 days          |
| Public disclosure                | After patch is released |

We’ll keep you updated throughout the process. If you do not hear back within 48 hours, feel free to send a reminder.

## Safe Harbor

We welcome and appreciate good-faith security research. As long as you:

- Limit your testing to your own accounts or demo environments.
- Do not access, modify, or delete any data you do not own.
- Do not degrade the service for other users.
- Promptly report any issues you find to us.

—you will not face legal action from the MERN Stack Ecommerce team.

## Acknowledgments
