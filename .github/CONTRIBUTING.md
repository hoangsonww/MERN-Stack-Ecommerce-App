## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork (adjust the URL to your fork as needed):

3. Create a new branch from `develop`:

- **Code style**: We use ESLint + Prettier. Your editor should auto-format on save.
- **Testing**: Add/update Jest tests under `__tests__/`.
- **Commit messages**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

  ```bash
  feat: add profile header sticky behavior
