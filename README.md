# Fusion Electronics: A MERN-Stack E-commerce Application

Welcome to Fusion Electronics, a MERN-Stack E-commerce Application! This project is a simple full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It aims to provide a comprehensive example of building a modern e-commerce platform, covering frontend user interface, backend server logic, database management, and integration with third-party libraries.

## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of building an e-commerce application using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB (database), Express.js (server), React.js (frontend), and Node.js (runtime environment). The application allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and simulate the order processing. It includes basic validations for user inputs and simulates the checkout process on the backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main "stacks": The backend is in the `backend` directory and the frontend is in the `root` directory. Here is an overview of the project structure:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (with npm)
- MongoDB (local or remote instance)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/fullstack-ecommerce.git
   cd fullstack-ecommerce
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install client (frontend) dependencies
   cd ..
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Set up the backend:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following environment variables:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Ecommerce-Products
     ```
 
    - Ensure that your MongoDB server is running. If you're using Mac, you can start the MongoDB server with the following command:
     ```bash
     brew services start mongodb-community
     ``` 

   - Seed the database with sample data:
     ```bash
     cd backend/seed
     node productSeeds.js
     ```
     
   - Run the backend server: (first `cd` into the backend directory)
     ```bash
     cd ..
     npm start
     ``` 
     
4. Set up the frontend:
   - First, `cd` into the `root` directory if you are not already there:
     ```bash
     cd ..
     ```
     Or
        ```bash
        cd fullstack-ecommerce
        ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Running the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Testing the APIs

- Simply open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/products` to view the list of products.
